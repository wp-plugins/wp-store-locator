== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-store-locator` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add your stores under 'Store Locator' -> Add Store
1. Add the map to a page with this shortcode: [wpsl]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add the store locator to a page? =

Add this shortcode [wpsl] to the page where you want to display the store locator.

= The map doesn't display properly. It's either broken in half or doesn't load at all. =

Make sure you have defined a start point for the map under settings -> Map Settings.

= I get an error saying the 'sensor' parameter specified in the request must be set to either 'true' or 'false' =

Make sure you don't have any security plugins, or custom functions running that strip away version numbers from file paths.

= Why does it show the location I searched for in the wrong country? =

Some location names exist in more then one country, and Google will guess which one you mean. This can be fixed by setting the correct 'Map Region' on the settings page -> API Settings.

= The store locator doesn't load, it only shows the number 1? =

This is most likely caused by your theme using ajax navigation ( the loading of content without reloading the page ), or a conflict with another plugin. Try to disable the ajax navigation in the theme settings, or deactivate the plugin that enables it to see if that solves the problem.

If you don't use ajax navigation, but do see the number 1 it's probably a conflict with another plugin. Try to disable the plugins one by one to see if one of them is causing a conflict.

If you find a plugin or theme that causes a conflict, please report it on the [support page](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-store-locator).
